This is a pet project of mine to implement the STUN protocol in pure Rust.

# Immediate TODO

* Start building sans-IO client that can handle RFC 5780.

# Future TODOs

* Read up on additional items (nonces, fingerprints, etc.)
* Look for different ways to describe the binary decoding (nom, other libraries?)
